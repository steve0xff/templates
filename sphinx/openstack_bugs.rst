How To Submit Bugs To OpenStack
===============================

1. Go to `launchpad.net <http://launchpad.net>`_.

2. If you don't have an account, make an account

3. Figure out which module (such as nova, keystone or glance) you want to file a bug for.

4. Find the page for that module. You can search launchpad, or you can build the url directly.

    - To build the url, add the module name to the end of the url. For example, the nova page would be `launchpad.net/nova <http://launchpad.net/nova>`_.

5. You should see a link to "Bugs" at the top of the page. You can also build the url manually by putting "bugs" at the beginning of the url. For example nova would be `bugs.launchpad.net/nova <http://bugs.launchpad.net/nova>`_.

6. You should search the current list of bugs for something similar to the one you are creating. If you cannot find one, choose the "Report a bug" option in the top right hand corner.

    - You will be asked to enter in a subject and any addtional information about the bug.
